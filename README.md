# Summary
Neural networks have become more important than ever.
However, testing techniques did not evolves compare to
the that of the neural networks. We showed that current
testing techniques have some limitation because of their
selection strategies, and suggest new technique, called **Adapt**,
that adaptively generates selection strategy with respect to
network to test, input seeds for testing, and coverage metrics
for evaluation.
